Lec - 1 How JS works:

    Index: (1) is JS Synchronous or Asynchronous?
           (2) is JS single threaded or multi-threaded?
    
    1. Everything in JS happens inside an execution context.
       Execution context is made up of two components i.e., memory component and 
       a) Memory component -  also known as variable environment, here, variable and functions are stored as the (key:value) pair. like a:10, fn:{...}
       b) Code component - also knows as thread of execution, is just like a thread in which the whole code is executed one line at a time.

            
            
            Execution context
-----------------------------------------
|Memory component   | code component    |
-----------------------------------------
| a: 10              | code line 1      |
| fn: {...}          | code line 2      |
|                    | code line 3      |
-----------------------------------------


    2. Javascript is a Synchronous single-threaded language i.e., JS can execute one line at a time with the 
       Synchronous(when one task is executed the execution of another task will not begin until the execution of first task is not finished) feature.
